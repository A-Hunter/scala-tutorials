  //  In Scala, operators are methods. Any method with a single parameter can be used as an infix operator.
  //  For example, + can be called with dot-notation:*
  val x = 10.+(1)
  //  However, itâ€™s easier to read as an infix operator:
  val x2 = 10 + 1

  val vector1 = Vec(1.0, 1.0)
  val vector2 = Vec(2.0, 2.0)
  val vector3 = vector1 + vector2 // => This "+" is the function defined in the class Vec
  val vector4 = vector1.+(vector2) // => This "+" is the function defined in the class Vec
  println(vector3.x) // 3.0
  println(vector3.y) // 3.0
  println(vector4.y) // 3.0
  println(vector4.y) // 3.0

  /**
    When an expression uses multiple operators, the operators are evaluated based on the
    priority of the first character:
    (characters not shown below)
    * / %
    + -
    :
    = !
    < >
    &
    ^
    |
    (all letters)

    This applies to functions you define. For example, the following expression:

    a + b ^? c ?^ d less a ==> b | c
    Is equivalent to :

    ((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) less ((a ==> b) | c)
    ?^ has the highest precedence because it starts with the character ?. + has the second highest
    precedence, followed by ^?, ==>, |, and less.
